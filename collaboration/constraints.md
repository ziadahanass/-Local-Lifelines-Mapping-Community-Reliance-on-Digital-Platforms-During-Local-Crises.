# 🌍 Project Constraints

This document outlines key limitations that influence collaboration on this
globally distributed project. Constraints are categorized into **external**
(outside our control) and **internal** (team-related) factors. Identifying
these early helps ensure realistic planning, effective communication, and
smooth execution.

## 🚧 External Constraints

These are conditions we cannot directly control but must plan around:

- **Internet Connectivity** 🌐  
  Limited or unstable access can impact communication, file sharing, and
  collaborative tools.

- **Resource Access** 🔧  
  Constraints in accessing required tools, hardware, or software may hinder
  progress or introduce delays.

## 🔒 Internal Constraints (Involuntary)

These stem from natural team limitations and need to be managed collaboratively:

- **Time Limitations** ⏳  
  Contributors may have restricted hours due to time zones, fixed schedules, or
  other responsibilities.

- **Competing Priorities** 🔄  
  Internal deadlines or overlapping responsibilities can reduce consistent focus
  on the project.

## 💡 Internal Constraints (Voluntary)

These are team-defined rules that guide how we work and help maintain quality:

- **Scoped Objectives** 🎯  
  Limiting the project scope to focus on core features and avoid unnecessary complexity.

- **Best Practice Commitments** 📑  
  Adhering to shared standards—clean code, proper documentation, testing, and
  code reviews.
