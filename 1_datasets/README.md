# Datasets

This folder contains data sources compiled for our research into access to higher education for refugee youth.

We structured this folder into three key documentation files, each focusing on a different type of data: raw datasets, global references, and scholarship or country-specific studies.

## RAWDATA.md

This file summarizes the raw reference materials used in our research. It includes links, brief descriptions, and source information for each dataset related to:

- global refugee enrolment  
- higher-education barriers  
- documentation and qualification recognition  
- scholarship programs  
- country-specific data (Lebanon)

The folder `rawdata_files` contains the raw documents used for our research into refugee higher-education access. As per the repository guidelines, these files are kept in their **original, unmodified state**.
